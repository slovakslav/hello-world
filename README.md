# hello-world

Hello everybody! Right now I am starting my new life, new hobby and letting my deepest dreams come true!
I WANT TO BE A DEVELOPER!

Some tips for learning?
I try everything from copywriting to making music. Sometimes i start FL Studio and trying to make something, but it's not cool as coding.
It's my dream when I was 11. Now, I have 18 years and I know little bit from Java.


My first official repository on GitHub.
